#### Reporting Issues and Bugs

Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/reactive-firewall/Pocket-PiAP/issues) if one does not
exist.

When opening an issue at a minimum please include details on
 - how to reproduce the problem (if practical)
 - any possible workarounds (if known)

Additionally:
 - patches are welcome (please patch against latest `stable` branch)
 - test cases are helpful
 - please note submitted code should have a author's by-line if not intended to be released under `Pocket PiAP`'s license (a pen name can be used to remain anonymous if so desired)
 - submitted code is not guaranteed to be accepted.
   - Rare objections are usually due to introduction of security flaws or code style flaws.
   - rejected code may be posted under you're own fork as a workaround if desired.

#### Reporting practical exploits and vulnerabilities

Be ethical, and be patient. `Pocket PiAP` IS STILL IN A PRIVATE BETA. If the security flaw is not fixed before the public beta more instructions are intended to be added here (at an indeterminate later time) to allow responsible discloser of such flaws.

 - due to lack of funding reporting rewards are not possible at this time. If you wish credit for finding a flaw, please include a note that you wish a byline with your disclosure.

 - security flaws may be reported to reactive.firewall+security@gmail.com

_What you can expect_:
 - Currently instructions to assemble a prototype system to run `Pocket AP` are constantly changing and thus are still a TO-DO item.
 - parts vary in cost depending on how you order them.
 - cost is usually around $118 (USD) (for the basic prototype)
