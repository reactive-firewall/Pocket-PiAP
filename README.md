### _Paranoia is a virtue_

In security perfection is rarely possible and almost certainly not practical. Defensive security comes down to risk management. `Pocket PiAP` is designed to _aspire_ to the following approach:

#### 1. `Pocket PiAP` aims to protect:

##### itself

###### * System Resources
_(Get your hand out of my `Pocket`)_
###### * System Connectivity
_(Wearing camo and serving human overlords does not mean registering for the bot-net draft)_
###### * System Data
_(Like a bag of water, `Pockets` are no good with lots of holes)_

##### Its clients

###### * Network Demarcation
_(Pay no attention to the system behind the `pocket`)_
###### * Network Trust
_(`pockets` should not set your pants on fire with lies)_
###### * Client Data
_(No one likes a pick-`pocket`)_

##### Their Interests

###### * User Dignity
_(Security should be ethical)_
###### * Entropy
_(Seriously how secure is your first guess?)_
###### * Usability
_(Security should be used)_

#### 2. `Pocket PiAP` is thus threatened:

##### Directly...

###### ...by threats to System Resources
 - loss of control of the `Pocket PiAP` (infection)
 - loss of use of the `Pocket PiAP` (dos)
 - loss of the `Pocket PiAP` (theft)
###### ...by threats to System Connectivity
 - loss of control of the `Pocket PiAP`'s connections (hijacking)
 - impersonation of the `Pocket PiAP`'s connections (spoofing)
 - loss of exclusive use of the `Pocket PiAP` (unauthorized access)
###### ...by threats to System Data
 - loss of exclusive use of data on the `Pocket PiAP` (data loss)
 - loss of data verification on the `Pocket PiAP` (data corruption)
 - exposure of data on the `Pocket PiAP` (data leak)

##### Indirectly...

###### ...by direct threats to the Clients
 - directly from by external adversaries (intrusion)
 - directly from by internal adversaries (treachery)
 - by hostile privileged users (abuse)
###### ...by indirect threats to the Clients
 - indirectly from by external adversaries (side-channel)
 - indirectly from by internal adversaries (broken clients)
 - indirectly from environmental factors (cas fortuit)
###### ...by threats to the Network
 - malicious control of network resources (rouge access points)
 - impersonation of indirect network resources (redirection)
 - impersonation of direct network resources (spoofing)
###### ...by threats to the Client Data
 - exposure of data in transit (data leak)
 - exposure of data at rest (data theft)
 - loss of data at rest (data loss)
 - loss of data at transit (data loss)

## ...and the list goes on (TODO: update this)
